### Components necessary for installation

Before beginning installation, make sure that you have:

1.  A USB Type-C type cable for configuration.

2.  At least 4-wire cable for connecting the communicator to the fire alarm control panel.

3.  A flat-head 2,5 mm screwdriver.

4.  An external Cellular antenna if network coverage in the area is poor.

5.  An activated nano-SIM card (PIN code requests can be turned off).

6.  The manual of the fire alarm control panel that the communicator will be connected to.

Order the necessary components separately from your local distributor.

## Powering the communicator

### Main power supply

The communicator must be powered by a DC source. A backup power supply – a 12 V battery – must be connected to the system to ensure the supply of power is uninterrupted.

### Backup power supply

If there are problems with powering the system from the main power supply, an “*DC Fault”* event report will be generated and the panel will automatically switch to the backup 12 V battery. If the battery’s voltage falls to 11,5 V, a “*Low* *Battery”* event report will be generated. The battery will be disconnected if the voltage falls bellow 9,5 V. If DC voltage is restored, an “*DC Restore”* report will be generated and the battery charging process will begin automatically. When the battery’s voltage rises to 12,6 V, a “*Battery Restore”* event report will be generated.

### Schematics of connecting the inputs of the fire panel to the communicator

According to the EN54 standard, the fire panel from the communicator must receive information about the failure of communication with the monitoring station, as well as about the successful received of messages to the monitoring station. It is necessary to connect the PGM outputs (for example: “Relay1” and “Relay2”) of the communicator to the special inputs of the fire panel. The PGM output of “Relay1” must be set to “CMS fail”. The PGM output of “Relay2” must be set to “ACK received”. “Relay1” output is activated in case of violation of the communication channel with the CMS. “Relay2” output is activated for 5 sec. upon successful sending of a message to the CMS.

### Turning on the communicator

To turn on the communicator, first you need to turn on its power supply. The communicator’s LED indicators must operate in the following way:

- The “**STA**” diode must blink in green – this indicates that the power supply voltage is sufficient;

- The “**SIM**” diode must be green solid and periodically blink in yellow no less than 3 times – the green color indicates that the SIM card is successfully registered on the mobile network, while the number of yellow flashes indicate the mobile signal strength. The “**ETH**” indicator lights up green when the communicator is connected to the LAN network.

!!! note
    Sufficient 4G mobile network strength is 3 (three yellow flashes of the “**SIM**” indicator). / If you see fewer yellow flashes of the “**SIM**” diode, the strength of the mobile network is insufficient. We recommend choosing a different place for installing the communicator, changing the location of the antenna or using a more sensitive mobile antenna. / If the light indication is different, see chapter 1.4 “LED indication of operation” to find out the reason. / If all of the FIRECOM indicator lights are off, check the power supply and connections.

### “Reporting to CMS” window

**“Reporting” tab**

<img alt="" src="./image77.png" style="width:7.086614173228346in;height:3.188976377952756in" />

The communicator sends messages to the Central Monitoring Station using internet (IP).

You can assign a backup channel to the primary channel. It will be used when connection via the primary channel is lost.

Messages sent to the Central Monitoring Station are encoded and password protected. To receive messages and forward them to monitoring software, a TRIKDIS receiver is required:

- For IP messages – receiving program IPcom Windows/Linux, hardware IP/SMS receiver RL14 or multi-channel receiver RM14.

**Settings group “Primary channel” (“Parallel channel”)**

- **Communication type** – choose a method for connecting to the Central Monitoring Station’s receiver.

- **Domain or IP** – enter the receiver’s domain or IP address.

- **Port** – enter the receiver’s network port number.

- **Protocol** – select in which coding the events should be sent: **TRK** (to TRIKDIS receivers), **DC-09_2007** or **DC-09_2012** (to universal receivers. By selecting the SIA DC protocol, you can select the SIA-DCS messaging format.), **TL150** (to SUR-GUARD receivers).

- **Encryption Key** – 6-digit message encryption key. The communicator’s encryption key must match the receiver’s encryption key.

If parameters are set for the parallel channel, reports will be sent using both channels simultaneously. Both channels cannot be configured for the same receiver.

**Settings group “Backup channel” (“Parallel backup channel”)**

Enable backup channel mode to allow messages to be sent using the backup channel if the connectivity is disrupted. Configure the backup channel using the same settings as described above.

**“Settings” tab**

<img alt="" src="./image78.png" style="width:7.086614173228346in;height:3.8464566929133857in" />

**Settings group “Settings”**

- **Return to Primary after** – time period after which the FIRECOM will attempt to regain connection with the “Primary channel”.
- **IP PING period** – sending period of internal PING signals for checking connectivity. These messages are sent only via IP channel. The receiver does not forward these signals to the monitoring software and thus does not overload the software. The monitoring software is only notified when the receiver does not receive a PING message from the device for a preset period of time.

By default, the receiver will send a “*Connection lost*” message to the monitoring software after a time period that is three times longer than the communicator’s PING sending period. E.g. if the IP PING period is 3 minutes, the receiver will send a lost connection message if it does not receive a PING for 9 minutes.

PING messages also keep an active connection session between the device and the receiver. An active session is required to configure and control the communicator remotely. We recommend setting the PING period to be no longer than 5 minutes.

- **Backup reporting after** – specify the number of unsuccessful attempts to send a message using the “**Primary channel”**. If the message fails to send after the specified number of attempts, the device will transmit using the “**Backup channel”**.

- **DNS1, DNS2** – (Domain Name System) server that specifies the domain IP address. It is used when a domain is specified in the connectivity channel’s “**Domain or IP”** field (instead of an IP address). Default setting - Google DNS server addresses.

The following settings are only shown when **DC-09_2007** or **DC-09_2012** protocol is chosen in the connectivity channel’s **Protocol** field.

- **Object ID in SIA DC-09** – <u>enter the object number. If you chose the DC-09 protocol, the object number entered in this field will be used</u>. You can enter the 3-16 symbol hexadecimal number given by the central monitoring station.

- **SIA DC-09 receiver No.** – enter the receiver’s number.

- **SIA DC-09 line No.** – enter the line number in the receiver.

- **Local time in SIA -** check the box so that the messages sent to the CMS indicate the time set in the module.

**Settings group “Reporting mode”**

For setting parameters on how the communicator will communicate with the CMS channels and with Protegus2. The connection types are specified in order. If the communicator fails to connect using the “**Main type”** connection , it switches to the “**Backup type”**, and so on. If the backup connection type was successful in transmitting the message to the CMS, then the “**Return to main”** connection type will be attempted after the specified time interval.

- **Main type** – select a connection type (SIM, Ethernet (LAN)) with the CMS receiver and Protegus2.

- **Backup type** – select a connection type (SIM, Ethernet (LAN)) with the CMS receiver and Protegus2.

- **Backup type 2** – select a connection type (SIM, Ethernet (LAN)) with the CMS receiver and Protegus2.

- **Return to main (both channel)** – time period after which the FIRECOM will attempt to regain connection using the *primary* channel, if it was running a backup channel, min.

**Settings group “LAN network parameters”**

- **DHCP mode** – mode for registering on the LAN network (manual or automatic). Tick the box and the FIRECOM communicator will automatically read the network settings (subnet mask, gateway) and will automatically be assigned an IP address (automatic registration mode).

- **Static IP** – static IP address for manual registration mode.

- **Subnet mask** – subnet mask for manual registration mode.

- **Default gateway** – gateway for manual registration mode.

- **LAN Trouble indication** – check the box so that the LED on the communicator lights up when the LAN communication link fails.

**Settings group “SIM parameters”**

- **Disable indication of the absence of a SIM card** – when the box is ticked, the FIRECOM communicator will not display an indication that there is no SIM card inserted.

- **Use dial and SMS when working over internet module** – ticking this box will enable controlling the communicator using phone calls and SMS messages. If the box is not ticked and there is a LAN network available, then SMS and phone calls are not used. If the box is not ticked and there is no LAN network, the FIRECOM can still be controlled using phone calls and SMS messages. The FIRECOM will send SMS messages to the user.

- **Disable the use of SIM card mobile data** – ticking the box will disable the usage of the SIM card’s mobile data. Data will only be sent using LAN. If a LAN network is temporarily unavailable, the FIRECOM will store data in memory. When the LAN network is restored, the FIRECOM will send data using LAN.
