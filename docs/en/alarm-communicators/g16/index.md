### “CMS reporting” window

**“CMS settings” tab**

<img alt="" src="./image39.png" style="width:7.082677165354331in;height:4.066929133858268in" />

The communicator sends events to the monitoring station via cellular internet (IP) or with SMS messages.

Events can be sent over several channels of communication. The primary and parallel communication channels can operate simultaneously, this way the communicator can send events to two receivers at the same time. Backup channels can be assigned for both primary and parallel channels, which will be used when the connection via the primary or parallel channel is interrupted.

Communication is encoded and password protected. A TRIKDIS receiver is required for receiving and sending event information to the monitoring programs:

- For connection over IP - software receiver IPcom Windows/Linux, hardware IP/SMS receiver RL14 or multichannel receiver RM14.

- To receive SMS messages - hardware IP/SMS receiver RL14, multichannel receiver RM14 or SMS receiver GM14.

SMS communication is particularly useful as a backup channel, because it works even when there is no mobile internet connection. We do not recommend SMS as a primary channel.

**“Primary channel” settings group**

- **Communication type** - select which method for connecting to the monitoring station receiver will be used: **IP** or **SMS**.

- **Protocol** - select in which coding the events should be sent: **TRK** (to TRIKDIS receivers), **DC-09_2007** or **DC-09_2012** (to universal receivers), **TL150** (to SUR-GARD receivers).

- **TRK encryption key** - 6-digit message encryption key. The key written to the communicator must match the receiver’s key.

- **Domain or IP** - enter the domain or IP address of the receiver.

- **Port** - enter the network port number of the receiver.

- **TCP or UDP** - select in which protocol (TCP or UDP) the events should be sent.

- **Phone number** (only for SMS messages) - enter the telephone number of a TRIKDIS SMS receiver. The phone number must begin with the country code (e.g., 370xxxxxxxx).

“Primary channel Backup” settings group

Enable the backup channel mode to send events via backup channel if connection via primary channel is lost. Backup channel settings are same as described above.

“Parallel channel” settings group

Events are transmitted in parallel with the first channel through this channel. When the second channel is enabled, events can be sent simultaneously to two receivers (e.g., local and centralized monitoring stations). Parallel channel settings are the same as described above.

Backup SMS reporting number

Backup SMS messages are sent when they cannot be transmitted via the primary, parallel and backup channels. It is especially useful because it works even when there is no IP connection in the mobile operator network.

This channel is operational only when IP mode is set for the first channel and its backup channel.

SMS notifications will be sent to the Central Monitoring Station SMS receiver: 1) immediately after the first time when communicator starts operating; and 2) if the TCP / IP or UDP / IP connection is interrupted in the first channel and its backup channel.

- **Backup SMS reporting number** - enter the phone number for TRIKDIS alarm receiving center’s SMS receiver. Phone number must begin with the country code (e.g., 370xxxxxxxx).

<img alt="" src="./image40.png" style="width:7.078740157480315in;height:2.8818897637795278in" />

****“Settings” tab** “Settings” settings group**

- **Test period** - TEST event period for testing the connection. Test events are sent as Contact ID messages and forwarded to the monitoring software.

- **IP ping period** – period for sending internal PING heartbeats. These messages are only sent via IP channel. The receiver will not forward PING messages to the monitoring software to avoid overloading it. Notifications will only be sent to the monitoring software if the receiver fails to receive PING messages from the device within the set time.

  By default, the “*Connection lost”* notification will be transmitted to the monitoring software if the PING message is not received by the receiver over a time period three times longer than set in the device. E.g. if the PING period is set for 3 minutes, the receiver will transfer the *“Connection lost”* notification if a PING message is not received within 9 minutes.

  PING heartbeats keep the active communication session between the device and the receiver. An active session is required for remote connection, control and configuration of the device. We recommend setting the PING period for no more than 5 minutes.

- **Backup reporting after** - indicates the number of unsuccessful attempts to send the message via Primary channel. If device fails to transmit specified number of times, the device will connect to transmit the messages via Backup channel.

- **Return from backup after** - time after which the G16 will attempt to reconnect and transmit messages via the Primary channel.

- **DNS1, DNS2** - (Domain Name System) identifies the server that specifies the IP address of the domain. Used when domain is set in the communication channel **Domain or IP** field (not IP address). Google DNS server is set by default.

“DC-09 parameters” settings group

The settings are displayed when the **DC-09_2007** or **DC-09_2012** protocol is set in the communication channel **Protocol** field for sending events to universal receivers.

- **Object ID in DC-09** - enter the object number. <u>The object number entered in this field will be used if DC-09 encoding is selected</u>. A hexadecimal number from 3 to 16 characters can be entered. This Number is provided by the Alarm Receiving Center.

- **DC-09-line No**. - enter line number of the receiver.

- **DC-09 receiver No.** - enter the receiver number.

## Test communicator performance

When the configuration and installation is complete, perform a system check:

1.  Generate an event:

- by arming/disarming the system with the control panel’s keypad;

- by triggering a zone alarm when the security system is armed.

1.  Make sure that the event arrives to the alarm receiving center and/or is received in the Protegus application.

2.  To test communicator input, trigger it and make sure to receive the correct event.

3.  To test the communicator outputs, activate them remotely and check their operation.

4.  If the security control panel will be controlled remotely, arm/disarm the security system remotely by using the Protegus app.

## Firmware update 

!!! note
    When the communicator is connected to TrikdisConfig, the program
    will automatically offer to update the device's firmware if updates are
    present. Updates require an internet connection. Antivirus software,
    firewall or strict access to internet settings can block the automatic
    firmware updates.
The communicator’s firmware can also be updated or changed manually. After an update, all previously set settings will remain unchanged. When writing firmware manually, it can be changed to a newer or older version. To update:

1.  Run ***TrikdisConfig**.*

2.  Connect the communicator via USB cable to the computer or connect to the communicator remotely.

    - If a newer firmware version exists, the software will offer to download the newer firmware version file.

3.  Select the menu branch **Firmware**.

4. Press **Open firmware** and select the required firmware file. If you do not have the file, the newest firmware file can be downloaded by <u>registered users</u> from [www.trikdis.com](http://www.trikdis.com) , under the download section of the G16 communicator.

2.  Press **Update [F12]**.

3.  Wait for the update to complete.

## Safety requirements
