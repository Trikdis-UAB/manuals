## Powering the security control panel

### Main power supply

The control panel and the entire alarm system can be powered either from an alternating or a direct current source. In both cases, a backup power supply – a 12 V battery – must be connected to the system to ensure the supply of power is uninterrupted. To meet the demands of the EN50131 standard, the backup battery must be able to work for 12 hours for security Grade II or 60 hours for security Grade III after losing power from the main power supply. Take into account the total current consumption of the additional connected modules, the current consumption of individual modules is listed in chapter 1.2 “List of compatible modules”.

### Backup power supply

If there are problems with powering the system from the main power supply, an *AC Fault* event report will be generated and the panel will automatically switch to the backup 12 V battery. If the battery’s voltage falls to 11,5 V, a *Low* *Battery* event report will be generated. The battery will be disconnected if the voltage falls bellow 9,5 V. If AC network voltage is restored, an *AC Restore* report will be generated and the battery charging process will begin automatically. When the battery’s voltage rises to 12,6 V, a *Battery Restore* event report will be generated.

## Installation of the system

### Recommended order of installation

**Planning the system:**

- Sketch a plan of the premises and mark the areas where the metal housing with the control panel, keypad (-s), signallers, equipment automatically or remotely controlled by the control panel will be installed.

- After evaluating the premises, the demands raised for their protection and the characteristics of possible sensors, choose the number of sensors to use, their types, and the locations to install them.

#### Installing the control panel into the mounting housing 

The control panel’s board can be installed into a mounting housing that already has a step-down transformer with a 500 mA fuse installed and also has space intended for a backup battery. / Install the control panel into the chosen plastic or metal housing using plastic spacers. If you chose a metal housing, do not forget to ground it during installation. The chosen housing must meet demands described in the EN 60950 and EN 50131 standards.

**Dimensions of the „FLEXi“ SP3 board**

The picture below shows the dimensions of the board and its mounting holes (in millimeters), and also the locations of the holes.

<img alt="" src="./image6.png" style="width:5.223344269466317in;height:3.9800076552930883in" />

#### Order of connecting devices

<img alt="" src="./image7.png" style="width:7.086805555555555in;height:3.292361111111111in" />

1.  Connect GSM and WiFi antennas to the antenna connectors.

2.  Insert an activated SIM card into the SIM card holder.

3.  Using the given connection schematics and the connection schematics for every device to be connected, connect the door and window magnetic contacts, motion, fire and other sensors, signallers, keypads and controlled devices. Connect the housing door and wall mounting tamper sensors to the panel’s terminals.

4.  Connect the wires of the main power supply to the control panel’s AC/DC terminals. Turn on the main power supply. The „FLEXi“ SP3 will recognize the keypads, expanders and interfaces that are correctly connected using 1-WIRE and YEL/GRN data busses.

5.  Insert a backup battery into the mounting housing. Connect the battery’s terminals to the BAT+ / BAT– terminals on the control panel.

!!! note
    The battery must recharge in less than 72 hours for the alarm system to
    meet security Class II or 24 hours to meet security Class III.
#### Recommendations for setting the control panel’s parameters 

6.  See chapter 5 “Setting parameters using TrikdisConfig” for information on how to connect to the panel to configure it.

7.  System settings:

    1.  **Partitions.** If you would like to turn on protection for specific zone groups separately, the alarm system can be divided into partitions. See chapter 5.2 ““System Options” window” on how to divide the system and set the required partition attributes.

    2.  **Zones.** See chapter 5.7 ““Zones” window” to set every zone according to the sensors’ characteristics and desired operation of the alarm after an event occurs in that zone. If the alarm system is divided into partitions, every zone can be assigned to a desired area.

    3.  **Users.** System *users* must be created to control the alarm system via keypad, iButton key or phone call (SMS message). See chapter 5.4 ““Users & Reporting” window” on how to create *users* and assign them permissions.

8.  Message sending:

    1.  **Time setting.** The control panel’s time must be set in order to receive messages with exact timestamps. See chapter 5.2 ““System Options” window”.

    2.  **Enable report sending.** Default settings enable the event report sending function for all events. If any event occurs, its report will be sent to the set recipients using the set channels. See chapter 5.10 ““System events” window” on how to disable reporting of chosen events.

    3.  **SIM card parameters.** If messages need to be sent using mobile networks, you must set parameters for the SIM card being used (see chapter 5.2 ““System Options” window”).

    4.  **Reports to central monitoring station.** Sending reports to the central monitoring station is disabled by default. See chapter 5.3 ““Reporting to CMS” window” on how to set parameters for sending messages to CMS.

    5.  **Reports to user.** Communication with Protegus cloud is enabled by default, and sending reports using SMS messages and phone calls is disabled. See chapter 5.10 ““System events” window” on how to set parameters for sending reports to the user’s mobile phone.

9.  Remote control of the system:

    1.  **User access.** The alarm system can be controlled remotely (via phone call and (or) SMS messages) by users whose phone numbers are entered into the User list. See chapter 5.4 ““Users & Reporting” window” on how to enter phone numbers.

    2.  **Control via phone call.** Phone calls allow not only to arm or disarm all or part of the security system, but also to control (turn on or off) equipment connected to PGM outputs. See chapter 4.4 “Control via phone call” on what parameters to change to allow phone calls to modify the state of a selected PGM output that has an equipment control circuit connected to it.

    3.  **Control via** **SMS** **messages.** With SMS messages, it is possible to change some of the control panel’s operational parameters, arm or disarm all or part of the premises, control (turn on or off) equipment connected to the PGM outputs. See the list of SMS commands on chapter 4.3 “Configuration and control via SMS messages”.

10. Additionally:

    1.  **Changing control codes.** We recommend changing the panel’s default alarm control and configuration codes to something only You know.

        - The **Master** user code can be changed in the branch **Users & Reporting** of the program menu.

        - **The remote SMS control** code can be changed in the **System Options** window of the program menu, in the **SMS Password** field of the **Access** section.

        - **Access codes for connecting with TrikdisConfig** can be changed in the **Access** section of the **System Options** branch of the program menu.

### Connecting sensors 

There are 10 terminals IO1–IO10 (inputs) on the control panel board for connecting sensor circuits. The number of inputs can be expanded to 32 using input expanders (***iO, iO8, iO-WL, RF-SH, iO-LORA, iO8-LORA**)*. Any terminal can be set as an input and assigned zone attributes: circuit type (NO, NC, EOL, EOL_T, 3EOL, ATZ, ATZ_T); sensitivity to temporary circuit events; zone function (Delay, Instant, Instant Stay, Interior, Interior Stay, Fire, Keyswitch, 24_hour, Silent, Silent 24h), see chapter 5.7 ““Zones” window”. The iO8 and iO8-LORA expanders support all types of zone resistor (EOL types) of the control panel.

### Turning on the control panel 

To turn on the control panel, first you need to turn on its power supply. The control panel’s LED indicators must operate in the following way:

- The PWR diode must blink in green – this indicates that the power supply voltage is sufficient;

- The NET diode must be green solid and periodically blink in yellow no less than 3 times – the green color indicates that the SIM card is successfully registered on the mobile network, while the number of green flashes indicate the mobile signal strength.

!!! note
    Sufficient mobile network strength is 3 (three yellow flashes of the NET
    indicator). / If you see fewer yellow flashes of the NET diode, the
    strength of the mobile network is insufficient. We recommend choosing a
    different place for installing the control panel, changing the location
    of the antenna or using a more sensitive mobile antenna. / If the light
    indication is different, see chapter 1.4 "LED indication of operation"
    to find out the reason. / If all of the „FLEXi" SP3 indicator
    lights are off, check the power supply and connections.

If the alarm is not disarmed during the set entry time, output signals for “Siren” and “Flash” are turned on and a report about the triggering of the alarm system is sent.
>
> When the alarm system is armed in STAY mode, “Interior Stay” zones are not protected.

- **Instant** – for connecting motion sensors. If the “Instant” zone is violated when the alarm is armed, OUT outputs “Siren” and “Flash” are turned on and a message about the alarm being triggered is sent.

- **Instant Stay** – for connecting motion sensors. If an “Instant Stay” zone is violated when the alarm is armed, OUT outputs “Siren” and “Flash” are turned on and a message about the alarm being triggered is sent. When the alarm system is armed in STAY mode, “Instant Stay” zones are not protected.

- **Fire** – for connecting fire sensors. If this zone is violated, OUT outputs “Siren” and “Flash” are turned on immediately and an event report is sent.

  - **Keyswitch** – for connecting a keypad or other switch. If the switch triggers this zone the security alarm will be armed or disarmed. The alarm will be armed after the set **Exit time** passes.

  - **24_hour** – for connecting glass break and tamper detectors. If this zone is violated, OUT outputs “Siren” and “Flash” are turned on immediately and an event report is sent.

  - **Silent** – if the alarm is armed and this zone is violated, an event report will immediately be sent, but “Siren” and “Flash” output signals will not be generated.

  - **Silent 24h** – for connecting panic buttons. If this zone is violated, an event report will immediately be sent regardless of the state of the security system, but “Siren” and “Flash” output signals will not be formed.
- **Type** – choose the type of circuit connected to the zone input IN from a list: NC – normally closed; NO – normally open; EOL – with an end of line resistor; EOL_T – with an end of line resistor and tamper monitoring; ATZ – two zone normally closed circuit with end of line resistors, without tamper monitoring function (to use this type, choose the second ATZ zone in the input list); ATZ_T – two zone normally closed circuit with end of line resistors, with tamper monitoring function (to use this type, choose the second ATZ zone in the input list); 3EOL - with an end of line resistor and tamper monitoring (this setting is for when motion detection with anti masking function is used).

- **Chime** - checking the box will enable the zone chime feature. When the zone is activated, the keypad will beep.

- **Bypass** – tick this box if you want to allow this zone to be bypassed and ignored when it is triggered.

- **Force** – tick this box if you want to allow arming the security system with the zone open. When the alarm is armed, open zones set to “Force” mode will be temporarily disconnected. After zone restore, they will be turned on and monitored again. A violation of this zone will trigger an alarm.

- **CMS** – if the box is ticked, zone event reports will be sent to the central monitoring station (CMS).

- **Prot.** – if the box is ticked, zone event reports will be sent to Protegus cloud.

- **Delay** – input IN zone reaction time, in milliseconds.
- **CID code** – event contact ID codes. This code will be filled in automatically after selecting a definition for the zone.

- **Sound** – specify the number of the voice recording that will be played back to the user when the „FLEXi“ SP3 control panel calls during an alarm (this function is valid for SP3_12xx control panel with firmware version up to 1.13 inclusive).
