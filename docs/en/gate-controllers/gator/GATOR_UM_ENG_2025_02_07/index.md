## Description

GSM gate controller can remotely control automatic gates and other equipment.

Users can control controller with Protegus2 application, telephone calls and SMS messages. The controller can recognize up to 7 administrator and 1000 user telephone numbers. A user control schedule and counter for how many times a specific user can control the system can be set for the controller. The GSM controller can send SMS messages informing when inputs and outputs are activated and restored (the text of the SMS messages is customizable). The controller is capable of sending event messages to the receiver of a security company. Connecting a WiFi (W485) or Ethernet (E485) module to the controller can send event messages and control the controller over a wireless or wired internet without using SIM card mobile data. By connecting the RF- LORA transceiver, up to 8 iO-LORA wireless expanders can be connected to the GATOR controller. RFID readers connected to the iO-LORA wireless expansion modules can control up to 8 PGM outputs (GATOR controller program version from 2.13). One iO-LORA expander with an RFID reader controls only one PGM output.

## Quick set up of the controller

!!! note
    The controller comes factory pre-configured to work. A call from any phone to controller’s SIM card number will turn on the 5 OUT relay output for 3 (three) seconds. The controller can be installed without any additional configuration if such operation mode is acceptable.

1.  A nano-SIM card must be inserted into the controller. Turn off PIN code requests for the card before inserting it into the controller.

2.  Connect a power source to the controller (see 2 “Wiring schematics for the cellular gate controller”).

3.  Turn on the power for the controller. This should trigger the following controller LED indications:

- The “POWER” indicator should blink green;

- The “NETWORK” indicator should be green solid and blink yellow.

The default settings allow control by anyone who calls the phone number of the SIM card inserted into the controller.

If you want to allow only particular people to control the controller, send an SMS command with user phone numbers, who are authorized (example SMS command: ***SETU 123456 +370xxxxxxxx#Peter#peter@trikdis.com**).* After receiving such command, controller will react only to the phone numbers on the list. The controller will ignore incoming phone calls from other numbers.

!!! note
    If you wish to alter the default settings or turn on other functions of the controller, refer to chapter 5 „Setting of parameters using TrikdisConfig software”.

## Remote control

### Control with phone call {#control-with-phone-call .2-Po-Pag}

!!! note
    The first one to call (or send an SMS to) the controller will become the system administrator and will be the only one who can administer and control the controller with SMS commands.
Call the number of the SIM card inserted into the controller. The controller automatically rejects the call and turns on the *5 OUT relay output* for *3 (three)* seconds. Default settings allow anyone who calls the number of the SIM card inserted into the controller to control.

### Control with phone keyboard {#control-with-phone-keyboard .2-Po-Pag}

Controller answers and allows to control the outputs with a phone call the user is allowed to control several outputs OUT:

1.  Call the controller’s SIM card number. The controller will accept the call.

2.  Using the phone keyboard, dial the control command (command examples can be found in the table **DTMF control commands**).

> **DTMF control commands (does not work with GV17_2E70, GV17_2S70 modules)**

| DTMF code | Function | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| OUTPUT*STATE# | Output control | Output control command (turn on/turn off; turn on/turn off for
pulse time).
OUTPUT – number of the controlled output.
STATE – control command:

0 – turn off output;
