# TRIKDIS Manuals (Public)

This repository hosts the public documentation site for TRIKDIS manuals. Content is written in Markdown and published with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to GitHub Pages.

## Repository Layout

```
mkdocs.yml                 # MkDocs configuration (theme, navigation, build settings)
docs/
  index.md                 # Landing page content
  manual/                  # Generated manuals live here (one folder per manual)
    index.md               # Manual content in Markdown (images in the same folder)
    image*.png             # Referenced illustrations (relative links e.g. ./image1.png)
  stylesheets/base.user.css# Shared styling used by MkDocs and Typora
```

All Markdown files live under `docs/`. MkDocs treats that directory as the site root when building.

## Conversion Pipeline

Manuals originate from DOCX files and are converted with the companion project `knowledgebase-conversion-pipeline`. The conversion scripts handle:

- extracting text/images into `docs/manuals/<manual-name>/`
- normalising headings and callouts
- ensuring image links use `./image.png` for safe relative paths

Typical flow for a new or updated manual:

1. From the pipeline project run `./convert-single.sh "docx manuals/<file>.docx"`.
2. Copy the generated folder to this repo: `cp -r <pipeline>/docs/<manual-name> docs/`
3. Run `python3 update_navigation.py && python3 generate_homepage.py` (or let GitHub Actions do it)
4. Commit and push

## Preview Locally

Run MkDocs in dev mode to inspect changes before pushing:

```bash
cd projects/trikdis-docs/manuals
pipx run --spec mkdocs-material mkdocs serve --dev-addr 127.0.0.1:8000
```

The command installs MkDocs Material (via `pipx`) if necessary and serves the site at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Stop with `Ctrl+C`.

### Quick restart on the shared preview port (127.0.0.1:8892)

We often reuse `mkdocs serve -a 127.0.0.1:8892` during multi-manual QA. The process sometimes leaves a background child bound to the port after you stop the parent, so a fresh `mkdocs serve` fails with `OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use`.

```bash
# Kill any stale preview instances first (fast, idempotent)
pkill -f 'mkdocs serve -a 127.0.0.1:8892' || true

# Relaunch in the background so the shell is free immediately
cd /Users/local/projects/trikdis-docs/manuals
nohup mkdocs serve -a 127.0.0.1:8892 >/tmp/mkdocs-serve.log 2>&1 &

# Confirm the listener (optional)
lsof -nP -i tcp:8892
```

With this sequence the old process is removed instantly and the new server starts within a second or two. Logs stream to `/tmp/mkdocs-serve.log` for inspection.

## Publishing Pipeline

Publishing is fully automated via GitHub Pages:

1. Push or merge into `main`.
2. The workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` checks out the repo, installs MkDocs + MkDocs Material, runs `mkdocs build --strict` (output in `site/`).
3. The built static site is uploaded as an artifact and deployed with `actions/deploy-pages@v4` to the `gh-pages` branch. GitHub Pages serves the result at `https://docs.trikdis.com`.

The deploy workflow also publishes a `CNAME` so the custom domain stays pinned to `docs.trikdis.com`. No manual intervention is needed after a push—wait for the Pages deployment badge to turn green.

## Automatic Navigation & Homepage

Both the navigation (`mkdocs.yml`) and homepage (`docs/index.md`) are automatically generated from the `docs/` directory structure.

### How It Works

1. **Scan docs/**: `update_navigation.py` finds all folders with `index.md` files
2. **Update nav**: Updates `mkdocs.yml` with discovered manuals
3. **Generate homepage**: `generate_homepage.py` creates homepage from nav structure

### Manual Updates

After adding a new manual to `docs/`:

```bash
python3 update_navigation.py    # Scan docs/ and update mkdocs.yml
python3 generate_homepage.py    # Generate homepage from nav
```

### Automatic Updates

During GitHub Actions deployment:
1. Navigation is auto-updated from `docs/` structure
2. Homepage is auto-generated from navigation
3. Site is built and deployed

**You don't need to manually edit `mkdocs.yml` or `docs/index.md`!**

### Category Detection

Manuals are categorized by folder name:
- `alarm-communicators/` → Alarm Communicators
- `control-panels/` → Control Panels
- `controllers/` → Controllers
- etc.

If no category keyword is found in the folder name, it defaults to "Alarm Communicators".

## Updating Styling

- Adjust shared styling in `docs/stylesheets/base.user.css`. Typora is symlinked to the same file, so changes affect both the local Markdown editor and the published site.

## Troubleshooting

- **Images missing**: ensure links look like `![](./image3.png)`; the conversion pipeline adds this automatically. MkDocs copies the files from `docs/manual/` into the published `manual/` folder.
- **New manual not visible**: verify it is referenced in `mkdocs.yml` and that the Pages workflow succeeded.
- **Local build errors**: run `pipx run --spec mkdocs-material mkdocs build` to get strict error messages before pushing.

With this setup, any future manual update is simply a conversion + commit + push cycle. The GitHub Actions workflow handles building and deploying the site automatically.
